In this workshop you will learn how to turn a couple of python scripts into
a full blown Python package. You will see how you can develop and maintain
this package independantly from your research projects and "pip install" to
reuse it across them, using virtual environments.
You will then learn the simple steps to make it possible for anyone to "pip
install" your package, automatically installing the required dependencies.

# Course requirements

-   A basic familiarity with Python 3
-   Python 3, pip and Git installed.


<a id="orge35d8eb"></a>

# Getting ready for the course

The course assumes that he following software is installed on your system:

-   Python 3 (3.3 or above)
-   The `pip` package manager to upload and download Python packages.
-   The `venv` Python module to create Python virtual environments.

Not sure? Plese [check your Python installation](#org361c598).

If you already have the above requirements satisfied, jump to [Setup the python environment for the course](https://github.com/OxfordRSE/python-packaging-course#setup-the-python-environment-for-the-course).
Otherwise, read on.

## How to install Python 3

We recommend install Python via
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). You can see Anaconda as a
bundle including Python itself + useful utilities (such as the `pip`
package manager) + several gigabytes worth of Python packages.  An
alternative to Anaconda is
[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), which is
essentially a stripped version of Anaconda.  It provides a lighter
Python distribution consisting of just Python + a handful of core
utility packages.

For the purpose of this course, it really doesn't matter if you
install Miniconda or Anaconda. If you'd rather save some disk
space and go for a shorter download, we recommend you go for
Miniconda.

-   Click [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation) for instructions on how to install Miniconda/Anaconda.

If you'd rather install Python outside of Anaconda or Miniconda,
check out [our instructions](https://oxfordrse.github.io/python-packaging-course/appendix_installing_python/#install-python-3-outside-of-anacondaminiconda) on how to install Python 3 outside of Anaconda/Miniconda.

If you encounter issues whilst installing any of the above, feel
free to get in touch by [opening an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/creating-an-issue) on this repository.

## Check your installation

First, check that you have Python 3 available with

    python --version


If you find that `python` refers to Python 2, try with `python3` instead.

Next, check that both `pip` and `venv` are available. They typically come along with
Python itself.

    python -m pip --version

    python -m venv --help
	

If any of the three commands above results in an error, please refer to 
the [installation instructions](https://github.com/OxfordRSE/python-packaging-course#installing-python-3). If you get stuck, please [open an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/creating-an-issue) 
this repository and we'll help you.

If not, congratulations! Python 3 is now installed and ready to go.
One last step, let's [setup the python environment for the course](#org6fff038).

## Setup the python environment for the course


<a id="org2908307"></a>

### 0. Make sure you have Git installed.

The commands in this section are meant to be entered in a terminal (GNU/Linux or MacOS) or a command prompt (Windows).

    $ git --version

If not, please install Git. On GNU/Linux Git is available *via* your package manager, for instance
on Ubuntu:

    $ sudo apt install git

On MacOS, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) once again:

    $ brew install git

On Windows, we recommend that you use [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).


<a id="org9a8985b"></a>

### 1. Clone the course GitHub repository

Open a terminal (on Windows you can use git-bash or the Anaconda prompt) and run the following command:

    $ git clone https://github.com/OxfordRSE/python-packaging-course.git


<a id="org28c088b"></a>

### 2. Create a Python virtual environment

Next, let's move into the course directory and create a virtual
environment.  Once this virtual environment activated, you'll work in
isolation from other Python versions installed on your machine, and
you can install any packages you want without fear or breaking any
dependencies for your other work.

Open a terminal (or the Anaconda prompt/command prompt if you're using Windows) and enter the following commands:

    $ cd python-packaging-course/
    $ python -m venv python-course-venv # just "python" for Anaconda/Miniconda
    # The following is GNU/Linux and MacOS only
    $ source python-course-venv/bin/activate # This activates the virtual environment

On windows use the following instead to activate the virtual environment.

    python-course-venv\Scripts\activate.bat
	
Again, you might need to type `python3` instead of `python` in order to use Python 3.


<a id="orgf94048a"></a>

### 3. Setup the course

Now that your Python 3 virtual environment is activated, typing
`python` at the command line will automatically call the Python 3
versions which was used to create the virtual environment (give
`python --version` a try).

Let's get the latest version of the Python package manager and install
the packages required to run the examples in the course.

    $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools
    $ python -m pip install course_setup/


<a id="org8d6d672"></a>

### 4. Deactivate your environment

That's all! You can deactivate your environment with the following command:

    $ deactivate

See you at the workshop!
